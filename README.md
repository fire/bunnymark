# BunnyMark

This is the classic BunnyMark benchmark for Godot Engine.

This is basically a port of the [Pixi.js version](http://www.goodboydigital.com/pixijs/bunnymark/). I'm new to Godot so send pull requests with performance improvements.

On my machine I'm getting about 6000 bunnies @ 60fps (Intel Core i5-2500K CPU @ 3.30GHz Ã— 4, GeForce GTX 660/PCIe/SSE2, 16GB memory).

Near as I can tell, the bunny image was created by [Iain Lobb](http://blog.iainlobb.com/2010/11/display-list-vs-blitting-results.html).
